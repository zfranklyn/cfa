# 10. Capital Budgeting

##### LOS 35.a: Describe the capital budgeting process and distinguish among the various categories of capital projects

Essentially, your company has capital and needs to figure out how to deploy it. There are four main steps:

1. Idea Generation
2. Analyzing project proposals
3. Create the firm-wide capital budget
4. Monitoring decisions and conducting a post-audit

###### Categories of Capital Budgeting Projects:
* Replcaement projects to maintain business
* Replace projects for cost reduction
* Expansion projects
* New product or market development
* Mandatory Projects
* Other Projects

##### LOS 35.b: Describe the basic principles of capital budgeting.

There are Five Key Principles:

1. Decisions are based on cash flows, not accounting income
	* Incremental Cash flows: changes in cashflow if the project is undertaken
	* Sunk costs
	* Externalities: effects on the firm's other cashflows (e.g., cannibalization)
	* Conventional/Unconventional Cashflow: sign on cash flow changes once/changes multiple times
2. Cash flows must account for **Opportunity Costs**
3. Time Value of Money
4. Cash flows analyzed **after-tax**
5. Financing costs must be reflected in a project's RRR

##### 35.c: Explain how the valuation and selection of capital projects is affected by mutually exclusive projects, project sequencing, and capital rationing.

This part is really straightforward. It's saying that some projects are mutually exclusive, and others require a certain sequence to execute. It's so straightforward I don't understand why this is an LOS.

##### 35.d: Calculate and interpret NPV, IRR, payback period, discount payback period, and profitability index of a single capital project.

The terms below are essentially metrics of evaluating projects. You should know these by heart.

###### Net Present Value (NPV)

Plain old NPV:

$$NPV = CF_0 + \dfrac{CF_1}{(1+k)}+ \dfrac{CF_2}{(1+k)^2} \,+ \,... \,+\, \dfrac{CF_n}{(1+k)^n}$$

###### Internal Rate of Return (IRR)

This is an extremely important metric, and you should know the concept and formula down cold. It's essentially asking: what is the discount rate that makes the present value of cash outflows equal to the present value of future cash inflows?

$$PV(inflows)=PV(outflows)$$

$$NPV = 0 = CF_0 + \dfrac{CF_1}{(1+IRR)^1} + \dfrac{CF_2}{(1+IRR)^2} + ... + \dfrac{CF_n}{(1+IRR)^n}$$

If your IRR > internal hurde rate, accept the project. Otherwise, reject it.

Note that from a mathematical perspective, this is pretty similiar to NPV. Except you have to use trial and error to calculate IRR. The core advantage to using IRR is that you can see how many percentage points the project is above your hurdle rate, while with NPV you only know the dollar amount.

###### Payback Period (PBP)

The number of years (double, not integer) it takes to recover the initial cost of an investment:

$$PBP=full\,years\,until\,recovery + \dfrac{unrecovered\,cost\,at\,start\,of\,the\,last\,year}{cashflow\,during\,the\,last\,year}$$

###### Discounted Payback Period

Almost the same procedure as PBP, except you're taking into account the Time Value of Money.

###### Profitability Index (PI)

Very similar to NPV: if NPV is positive, PI is positive, likewise for negative.

$$PI=\dfrac{PV(future\,cash\,flows)}{CF_0} = 1 + \dfrac{NPV}{CF_0}$$

##### 35.e: Explain the NPV profile, compare the NPV and IRR methods when evaluating independent and mutually exclusive projects, and describe the problems associated with each of the evaluation methods.

An **NPV profile** is a graph that plots a project's NPV against Cost of Capital.
