# Portfolio Risk and Return: Part I

### LOS 41.a: Calculate and interpret major return measures and describe their appropriate uses.

Short LOS right? tremendously important. These next few measures are literally the backbone of evaluating investment return, so you'd better know them down cold.

###### Holding Period Return (HPR), percentage return

This is about as simple as it gets: the percentage increase in value of an investment over a given time period.

$$holding\,period\,return = \dfrac{ending\,value}{beginning\,value} - 1 = \dfrac{P_t-P_0 + Div_t}{P_0}$$

###### Arithmetic Mean Return

Remember that by $R$, we're talking about a percentage return, not the actual amount earned. For instance, in Year 1 you earned 10% on \$100, $R_1=0.10$.

$$arithmetic\,mean\,return=\dfrac{R_1+R_2+...+R_n}{n}$$

###### Geometric Mean Return (percentage)

Compound annual rate, like in "compound" interest.

$$geometric\,mean\,return=\sqrt[n]{(1+R_1)*(1+R_2)*...*(1+R_n)} - 1$$

###### Money-Weighted Rate of Return

Essentially: IRR on a portfolio based on all of its cash inflows and outflows.

* *Inflows:* beginning value and additional deposits of cash, dividends or interest *received*
* *Outflows:* withdrawals of cash, interest and dividends *reinvested*, ending value

This is a bit of a confusing concept, so let's use an analogy. Imagine a pool of money.

	|			|		|    |		|			|
	|Your Wallet|		|Pool|		|Investments|
	|___________|		|____|		|___________|

Anything going into the Pool is considered an inflow, and anything out of the pool is an outflow. So if your blue chip stock gives you a cash dividend, then it's an inflow to your pool. But if you reinvest the dividend, then it becomes an outflow (as it flows from the Pool back into the Investments box).

Once we define our inflows an outflows, we need to discount all the numbers back to the present value, and solve for the IRR that makes the following equation true:

$$PV_{inflows}=PV_{outflows}$$

Since the MWRR can be affected by movements between Your Wallet and the Pool, it's not the best metric to evaluate investment performance. That's where TWRR comes in:

###### Time-Weighted Rate of Return

TWRR is the compounded growth rate of \$1 invested over the period being measured. Essentially, you need to split your investment performance every time there is an inflow/outflow of cash, and calculate the individual performance of each segment. Then, you find the geometric mean of all the segments.

This is a much fairer way to evaluate manager performance, as it factors out the effect of withdrawals and deposits.

###### Other Measures

* Gross return: total return on security portfolio before all fees
* Net return: returns net of fees
* Pretax nominal return
* After-tax nominal return
* Real return: nominal return adjusted for inflation
	* Imagine you invest \$1,000, and get a 5% return = \$1,050
	* Inflation is 2%
	* Your real return is 1.05/1.02 =~ 1.0294
* Leveraged return

##### LOS 41.b: Describe characteristics of the major asset clasess that investors consider in forming portfolios.

I'd consult Swensen's book on this, but here's the list according to the CFA Institute:

* Small-cap stocks
* Large-cap stocks
* Long-term corporate bonds
* Long-term Treasury bonds
* T-bills
* Inflation

Each of those has different levels of risk, return, and liquidity.

##### LOS 41.c: Calculate and interpret the mean, variance, and covariance (or correlation) of asset returns based on historical data.

Ready for some stats? The best way to remember these formulas is to get an intuitive understanding of how they work.

###### Standard Deviation

Essentially, how much does a variable deviate from its mean? If we wanted to find some way to quantify that, we'd probably want to look at how far away each sample data point is from the overall sample mean. How do we quantify that?

$$(sample_1 - mean) + (sample_2 - mean) + ... + (sample_n - mean)$$

In math lingo, let's call a the full set of sample data $X$, an individual point $x$, and the sample mean as $\overline{x}$. That brings us to:

$$\sum\limits_{i=1}^Nx-\overline{x}$$

But wait! What if you have positive and negative distances? Won't those cancel out? You're so right! So let's square each term:

$$\sum\limits_{i=1}^N(x-\overline{x})^2$$

Okay, now we have this massive number summing all the squared distances between each point and the sample mean. How do we get an average distance? Well, you take the average:

$$\dfrac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^N(x-\overline{x})^2}{N-1}$$

Hold up right there - that formula above is also known as *variance*. It should be a pretty large number, because you squared everything!

What if we wnated to get back to the original units? Sure, just unsquare everything:

$$\sqrt{\dfrac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^N(x-\overline{x})^2}{N-1}}$$

And voila! the formula for *standard deviation*.

###### Covariance and Correlation

Covariance is a pretty confusing one, but you need to understand it. Essentially, we want to see how much two variables covary - that is, move together.
