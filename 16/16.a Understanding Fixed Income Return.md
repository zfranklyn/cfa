# Understanding Fixed Income Return

### Using the BA-II Plus

If you want to calculate the future value of an annuity, you're essentially asking the calculator: what lump sum do I need to pay at the end of the annuity (FV) in order to make the present value (PV) of the annuity equal to zero?

### LOS 54.a: Calculate and interpret the sources of return from investing in a fixed-rate bond

Three sources of return:

* Coupon and principal
* Reinvested coupon payments
* Capital gain or loss if bond is sold prior to maturity

The relationship here is pretty intuitive. At the time you purchased the bond, it had a *YTM (Yield-to-Maturity)*, which represents the actual return of the bond (as opposed to the coupon rate of the bond). YTM depends on your purchase price.

There are a few scenarios:

1. If you hold to maturity, your return is the YTM at purchase.
2. If you sell before maturity, then your RoR will equal YTM if YTM at sale has not changed since purchase.


...

**Annualized Holding Period Rate of Return**

Think about it: your return is the total influx of money (including coupon payments, sale/maturity value, interest earned on reinvested coupons), and your investment is your purchase price.

To obtain the annualized version of the return, simply raise to the power of a fraction.

Usually, you'll be required to know two key things: purchase price, total return.

Let's calculate the purchase price of a bond where: 5-year bond, 8% coupon rate, 10% YTM, face value of $100,000.

This is a discount bond, because the coupon rate is lower than the market YTM. This means the bond will sell for less than its face value. Using our BA-II Plus calculator, we can find the present value of the bond by:

* I/Y = 10%
* FV = $100,000
* N = 5 years
* PMT = \$100,000 * 0.08 = \$8,000
* CPT(PV) = -\$92,418.43

The present value is negative, because that's how much you'd have to shell out in order to obtain the above bond.

Now what if we wanted to calculate the bond's total cash return? Well, we'd need to know the coupon amount, as well as the amount received from reinvesting coupons at the prevailing YTM.

There are two ways to calculate this. The most intuitive is just to assemble the following expression:

$$\$8000 + \$8000(1.1) + \$8000(1.1)^2 + \$8000(1.1)^3 + \$8000(1.1)^4 = \$48,840.8$$

And how much of that comes from reinvested coupons? Well simply subtract the total coupon cash amount:

$$\$48,840.8 - 5(\$40,000) = \$8,840.8$$

The second method, using the BA-II Plus, is to ask the question: what is this above cashflow worth at time of maturity? This question can also be understood as: what is the face value at maturity that would make this cashflow's present value equal to zero?

That probably sounds convoluted, but think about it for a moment. If the present value of a bond were zero (and we assume a constant positive coupon rate), then the FV (Face Value) paid at maturity would have to cancel out all those coupons. The FV paid at maturity would be the total cash amount received from the bond.

So let's plug that into the BA-II:

* PMT = \$8,000
* N = 5 years
* PV = 0
* I/Y = 10%
* CPT(FV) = \$48,840.8

Voila! We arrive at the same amount.
